<!-- About the Project -->
## :star2: About the Project
The project leverages machine learning to derive data-driven insights and develop market-oriented expansion strategies for enterprises. The proposed framework combines classic business models with advanced machine-learning techniques. Internally, the model uses the BCG matrix and word clouds to analyse product performance. Externally, it performs sentiment analysis on social media data to cluster text and identify market demand. Finally, integrating these internal and external insights provides a comprehensive perspective through a SWOT analysis. The framework has been tested with secondary data, offering robust market research to help new market entrants understand product dynamics in target markets.

<!-- Purpose -->
## :camera: Purpose
This model proposes a data-driven intervention to enhance the accuracy of market research by integrating internal and external data, reducing biases. Utilising primary data and machine learning aims to improve data processing efficiency and minimise pre-interpretation concerns from business frameworks. This solution combines external market analysis with internal product performance evaluation, offering a comprehensive, machine learning-assisted approach to market research.
